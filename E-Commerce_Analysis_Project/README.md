# E-Commerce Sales Analysis Project

## 1. Introduction

This project aims to analyze a simulated e-commerce sales dataset for the year 2024 to identify key business insights and trends. The analysis was performed using both Python for data generation and visualization, and Excel for further exploration and reporting.

## 2. Dataset Generation and Tools

The dataset was programmatically generated using Python's **Pandas** and **Faker** libraries to simulate realistic sales data. The key tools used in this project are:
* **Python:** For data generation, cleaning, and initial visualization.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating professional-looking charts.
* **Excel:** For creating interactive PivotTables and a dynamic dashboard.
* **Canva:** For designing enhanced, aesthetically pleasing charts for the final report.

## 3. Analysis & Key Findings

The analysis of the `sales_data.csv` revealed several key insights:

### Monthly Sales Trend

* As seen in the charts, total sales fluctuated throughout the year. The months with the highest sales revenue are **Mart and November**.

### Best-Selling Product Categories

* The analysis shows that **Beauty** was the leading category in terms of total revenue, followed by **Home & Garden**. This suggests a strong customer preference in these areas.

### Customer Demographics

* The customer base is most concentrated in the **20-40** age group. This demographic information is crucial for targeted marketing efforts.
* The top three cities in terms of sales count are **Bursa, Ä°zmir, and Konya**.

## 4. Conclusion & Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are some key takeaways and recommendations:
* **Recommendation 1:** The company should focus its marketing efforts on the high-performing product categories like **Beauty** to maximize revenue.
* **Recommendation 2:** Running special promotions during low-performing months could help stabilize revenue throughout the year.
* **Recommendation 3:** Targeting marketing campaigns toward the dominant customer age group **(20-40)** and top-performing cities could yield significant results.
